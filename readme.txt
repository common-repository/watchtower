Uptime and performance auditing, monitoring and alerting for WordPress.

== Description ==
Watchtower is a plugin that monitors your WordPress website and alerts you of any issues that show up unexpectedly. Think of it as your WordPress guardian angel.

While we're still quite fresh, we're constantly growing and expanding the features of the plugin. We currently support uptime monitoring, performance auditing/tracking and alerts/notifications.

Watchtower is free but there is a [Pro plan](https://usewatchtower.com) which allows you to super charge the features of the plugin to include things such as SMS sending and faster alert/audit times.

= Uptime Monitoring =
Watchtower notifies you when your WordPress website is down. Once connected, we'll constantly ping your WordPress website and notify when it is unavailable or returning an error.

= Performance Monitoring =
Performance can the difference between a user continuing to browse your website and clicking the close tab button. It also helps you rank better in the search engines and improve your SEO. Watchtower lets you know exactly where you stand in terms of performance.

= Web Vitals =
Our performance metrics are powered by Web Vitals by Google. Google has developed key metrics around performance of websites called [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/). We track these metrics on an ongoing basis and report the results back to you.

= Notifications =
Configuring notifications is easy in Watchtower. Add as many email, SMS or Whatsapp contacts as you'd like and they'll all receive alerts when activated.

= Reporting =
Watchtower reports on uptime issues and performance directly from your WordPress dashboard. You'll be able to check your stats over a given time period and see a list of alerts that have been sent.

= Pro Plan =

As mentioned, Watchtower is free. If you'd like faster alerting, SMS alerts and other more advanced features you can upgrade your account. Check out the [Watchtower](https://usewatchtower.com) website to see the Pro features that are available and the pricing.

== Installation ==
Installation is simple! Download and add the plugin to WordPress (or use the WordPress plugin installer). Once the plugin is installed, activate it.

Upon activation, you'll see the Watchtower menu item added to the WordPress admin menu. Click Watchtower and you'll be asked to connect to the Watchtower service. This will take less than 2 minutes and your website will be connected. You can now start using the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
